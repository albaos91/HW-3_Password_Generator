 # HW-3_Password_Generator 

Creating an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Motivation

Employees with access to sensitive data want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria. I am creating a strong password that provides greater security.

## Framework used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I need a new secure password when I click the button to generate a password,
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

- WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

- WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

- WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

- WHEN I answer each prompt THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

- WHEN all prompts are answered THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

- WHEN the password is generated THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Installation

1. I started the project by declaring my variables
2. As variables I listed my criterias: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters and numbers
3. Then I created the prompts for each criteria and made sure they ran
4. You can use console.log to make sure your code is running
5. I created an if statement to make sure that if a user enters less then 8 and more than 128 characters a notifying prompt would pop up.
6.
